# sql-suite
A collection of plans for my 2019 Fall Undergraduate research project: SQL-specific vim plugins.
* Goal 1) Prettify and code-check SQL queries by syntax highlighting tables/attributes 
* Goal 2) Make database modifications as elegant as vim commands by providing a window for vim edits on your own database
